        <p id="red"> 	Right now i’m the best person i can be right now. I attend Olney charter high school in Philadelphia. At the moment, I’m at SMASH academy, a program for children who want to go into a career involving STEM. Next year I will be going into the 10th grade and officially become a sophomore. Some subjects I really is math and science. My goal right now is to become a game designer. Main reason is because I really like to play games and so creating games would really match me and what I like do.
